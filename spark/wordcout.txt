Sentiment analysis is a common application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies, 
particularly classification, whose goal is to extract the emotional content in text. 
In this way, sentiment analysis can be seen as a method to quantify qualitative data with some sentiment score. 
While sentiment is largely subjective, 
sentiment quantification has enjoyed many useful implementations, 
such as businesses gaining understanding about consumer reactions to a product, 
or detecting hateful speech in online comments.

The simplest form of sentiment analysis is to use a dictionary of good and bad words. 
Each word in a sentence has a score, 
typically +1 for positive sentiment and -1 for negative. 
Then, we simply add up the scores of all the words in the sentence to get a final sentiment total. 
Clearly, this has many limitations, 
the most important being that it neglects context and surrounding words.
 For example, in our simple model the phrase “not good” may be classified as 0 sentiment, 
 given “not” has a score of -1 and “good” a score of +1. 
 A human would likely classify “not good” as negative, 
 despite the presence of “good”.
